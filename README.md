# TxtDataType
  this repository takes the datatype(only python dataTypes) of a text file
  
# Example:
  if file.txt contains "hello world" with the single or double quotes, is a String.
  if file.txt contains {'spam':'eggs'} is a dictionary.
  if file.txt contains [1,2,3] is a list with intigers 
  if file.txt contains ['1', '2', '3'] is a list with strings
  
# NOTE:
  is like the syntax of python, if you miss a quote in the string, it will cause an error
